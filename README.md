## What is this place?

It's a collection of small programs that I've found interesting for my own
personal education and interest. They are typically algorithms, or they set
out to solve a task that proved non-trivial for some reason.

### Why the name?

Github chose it. :)

## Table of Contents

### Build with CMake
- countsort - an implementation of the count sort algorithm in C
- countsortcpp - an implementation of the count sort algorithm in C++, making as much use of rvalue/move semantics as possible
- fibonacci - a Fibonacci series generator as a C++ template
- webradio - an ICY stream reader that requests metadata, strips it out of the stream and logs it, and passes the remainder out to a FIFO, for use by a decoder/player like GStreamer
