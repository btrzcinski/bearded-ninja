## Notes

This project proved interesting for several reasons. Implementing this function (adequately) involves demonstrating:

* Optional-parentheses syntax - when to use them, when you don't have to
* Implicit generic typing such that all lists of all search term types are accepted, but the search term type must match the list term type
* Using `fun` to create a lambda function
* Using `map` and `zip` to run through the test data and display the results
* Using the `rec` keyword to designate a recursive function
* Using the `EntryPoint` annotation to designate a `main` function for F# executables
